  <p><span class="emp1">Kelly’s Olympian was established in 1902.</span></p>
  <p>The name was derived from the name of one of the original owners, “Kelly”, and the Olympia Brewing Company, which was involved in the inaugural opening so that it could sell its product, Olympia Beer. It was originally called “The Olympian Saloon”.  The name “Kelly’s” was added a few years later.</p>
  <p><span class="emp2">Kelly’s Olympian is Portland’s third oldest continuously opened and operated bar and restaurant.</span></p>
  <p>In the early days, it was a popular gathering spot for locals as well as visiting timbermen, sailors, shipyard workers, longshoremen and others passing through. In addition to being a popular bar, it had the reputation for having one of the most well-known card rooms in Portland.</p>
  <p>Legend has it that there used to be several secret entrances to the Shangai Tunnels, where Chinese immigrants and dockworkers lived and made their way about the underground of Portland. The Shangai Tunnels are a unique part of Portland’s history and the connection to Kelly’s Olympian adds to its colorful past.</p>

  <p>In one section of the basement is a peculiar patching of the wall and remnants of an old tile floor, from a rumored speakeasy that existed during the Prohibition years of the 1930’s. There are stories of supernatural sightings of some of the past customers and employees that still come back to visit periodically, in a friendly way.</p>

  <p><span class="emp1">Kelly’s Olympian was family owned and operated for three generations by the Powers family of Portland for the majority of its existence.</span> <br>Greg Powers, recently retired has now passed on ownership to Ben Stutz and Jeff Mincheff, two local business partners.</p>

  <p>The crowning glory is the collection of a dozen vintage motor cycles hanging from the ceiling and about, each restored to perfection. One of the owners is a motorcycle enthusiast and finally found a home for his impressive motor cycle collection. Complementing the motor cycles are other motor cycle accessories, combined with museum quality neon signs, antique gas pumps and historic photos of Portland and motor cycles.</p>

  <p><span class="emp3">Kelly’s is proud to be one of Portland’s oldest bars and restaurants and enters the twenty first century, retaining its history while making its mark as one of Portland’s most unique and entertaining social gathering landmarks.</span></p>
